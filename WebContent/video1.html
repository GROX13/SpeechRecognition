                        	Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
							Take a sad song and make it better
							Remember to let her into your heart
							Then you can start to make it better
							
							Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
							You were made to go out and get her
							The minute you let her under your skin
							Then you begin to make it better.
							
							And any time you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
							Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
							Well don't you know that its a fool who plays it cool
							By making his world a little colder
							
							Hey, Jude! Don't let her down
							You have found her, now go and get her
							Remember, to let her into your heart
							Then you can start to make it better.
							
							So let it out and let it in, hey, Jude, begin
							You're waiting for someone to perform with
							And don't you know that it's just you, hey, Jude,
							You'll do, the movement you need is on your shoulder
							
							Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
							Take a sad song and make it better
							Remember to let her into your heart
							Then you can start to make it better

                        <p>
                        Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
                        Now it looks as though they're here to stay
                        Oh, I believe in yesterday

                        Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
                        There's a shadow hanging over me.
                        Oh, I yesterday came suddenly

                        Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
						I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
