                    <h2>Hi !</h2>
                    <p>Search by Voice represents the functional adjustment for websites,</p><p>that will make search engines more effective.</p></h1>

<p>While uploading the video on website, the program generates the text using speech recognizer and automatically writes it in the description of the video.</p>
<p> So user can search video not only by the title, but with the generated text as well.</p>
<div>
<p>This innovation can cause various positive results:</p>

<ul>
<li> Uploading the videos on the websites will be easier. Authors of the videos can us special button to show full video text in the description.</li>

<li>
<p>The effectiveness of the searching process will increase, because the user will be able to search the video file using the words, that were said in video, in spite of the order, search engine still finds exact video file. Using search by voice feature, users can search video or audio files as effectively as searching text files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p> Search by voice is effective for any file, which has audio or video format. Mostly program is effective for educational purposes. Users can upload video lectures and they will not have difficulty for understanding the text.</p>

<p> Search by voice can successfully generate the music texts as well. So users who do not remember the title of the song, can search it by the lyrics or by the words they remember from the song, because as we have mentioned above, search engine finds files in spite of the words ordered correctly.</p>

<p>Search by voice has one more feature. After the text from video or audio file is generated, user can click on any word in the description of the video file and program will rewind video to the exact moment, when the word was said. This feature will be useful for movie lovers, who will be able to find easily exact moment in the movie. Also it will be useful for students, who are trying to find exact moment in video lecture.</p>
